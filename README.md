## Welcome to my profile! 👋

My full name is Lawrence Glory Xie but to everyone who knows me, I just go by Larry!

I am an aspiring Software Engineer who is passionate about learning and integrating new technologies and skills with experience in Software Development, Full Stack Development, Backend Engineering and Customer Consulting and Relations.

I am a very knowledge driven person who loves the thrill of knowledge seeking and learning new things! It activates a part of my brain and scratches that itch that I have for it. Everything that I have learned to do: Programming, game design, web development, machine learning, etc has always been because of my curiosity.

## Current Skills and Experience

My work in Full-Stack Engineering spans the entire MERN stack:
- (Frontend) : ReactJS
- (API Web Framework) : ExpressJS
- (Enviroment) : NodeJS
- (Database) : MongoDB


My experience in UX/UI Design and Consulting has given me:
- A deeper appreciation of the importance of proper communication with teammates and clients.
- The ability to manage stakeholder expectations by presenting data-driven design strategies and navigating conflicting priorities to ensure project alignment.
- A wealth of communication soft skills that allow me to excel in fostering cross-functional collaboration.
